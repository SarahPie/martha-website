# Admin website for the MARTHA application

Admins can upload files here and they will automatically be available on the MARTHA application. User can also view lessons that are currently in the MARTHA database. The entire website is a Progressive Web Application and thus accessible offline after the first visit. 

Repository for the MARTHA application can be found here: https://github.com/LeilaScola/lionFE
